### App Concept
The purpose of this mobile web app is to allow users to easily record and track parishable items that they have in their fridge so they can be reminded to use them before they expire. If possible, we would also like to allow users to get suggested recipies for the ingredients that they have on hand, and even prioritize such recipie suggestions so as to use the soon to expire itmes first.

### Proposed UX/UI Layouts and Design:

### Technology Used:

  * [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) - for a user responsive front end Javascript framework
  * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - for Javascript based server code and logic
  * [express](https://expressjs.com/) - companion Web Framework for node.js
  * [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - for the App storage and database
  * [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) - for node to directly recieve and send data to our MySQL database via GET and POST requests.
  * [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/downloads/html/) - for node based user authentication
  * [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/) - a UI framework that uses the power of Bootstrap with REACT applications
  * [React Notifications](http://minhtranite.github.io/react-notifications/) - a REACT based notifications package that creates notification based alerts
  * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - for app deployment and hosting
  * A folder struction that follows the MVC Pardigm
  * Custom Javascript, HTML, and CSS - for everything else!

### USER Stories/ Features

1. User account creation and login, if possible a remember me option as well.

2. Quick data-entry of perishable items

3. An internal database with pre-seeded food types and their suggested expirations based on common food types. For example: Raw Meat 3 days, Deli Meat 7 days, Milk 2 weeks, Soft Fruit 1 week, Firm Fruit 2 weeks etc

4. Options to Find, Update, and Delete entries of users perishable items as well as the ability to see them sorted by expiration

5. Some sort of logic to calculate days remaining till expiration when a user opens the app

6. Users should see some sort of Toast, or Notification upon opening the app if one or more of their entered items is about to expire.
